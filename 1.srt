1
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:17,694
Hey, Youngjae

2
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,028
Hey

3
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,572
Why didn't you come to the reunion yesterday?

4
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,449
Ah, I had some work to do.

5
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,743
The guys waited so much for you.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,705
Hey, everyone's busy, but they made time to come.

7
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:30,748
Jisoo was making a fuss about wanting to see you.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,417
Ah, really?

9
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,169
Yeah, make sure you come next time.

10
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,170
Okay, I got it.

11
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,592
Ah, reunions...

12
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:42,969
You need something to show off to go there.

13
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:49,017
What?

14
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,145
You're Choi Jaemin, right?

15
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:53,730
Class 5 of Yangseo High School, 2nd grade.

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,357
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:00:58,818 --> 00:00:59,652
Kim Nam-i?

18
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,446
Yes.

19
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,824
Ah, at the reunion yesterday

20
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:06,325
We were really looking for you.

21
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,744
You didn't show up?

22
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,538
Ah, I had some work...

23
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,332
Ah, you were busy.

24
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,959
Did I interrupt you?

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,793
No, no, not at all.

26
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:16,836
I've just finished up.

27
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,305
No, remember when we skipped class together?

28
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:28,765
And we got caught by the homeroom teacher right away.

29
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:31,684
You got caught and I ran away.

30
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:32,727
The next day,

31
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,979
You never mentioned my name to the end.

32
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,230
Remember that?

33
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,066
Ah, did that happen?

34
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,734
Yes, it did.

35
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,820
I felt so sorry inside.

36
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,614
Watching you walk like a duck alone,

37
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:46,240
around the sports field.

38
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,577
I really thought that was true loyalty!

39
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:53,206
Ah, I remember now.

40
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:53,748
Right?

41
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,834
It was fun back then though.

42
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,252
Sorry but,

43
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,754
it's our closing time.

44
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:01,881
Oh sorry, I'll get up now.

45
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:03,758
Wow, it's already this late.

46
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,134
Where do you live?

47
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,552
I live in Ilsan.

48
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:07,637
Ilsan?

49
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,847
Then you have to take a bus.

50
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,307
Is there still a bus at this time?

51
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:12,642
I need to catch the last bus.

52
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,518
Let’s hurry.

53
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:20,691
We missed it.

54
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:22,693
What should we do?

55
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,202
Is it near your house?

56
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:32,912
My house?

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,622
Yes.

58
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:36,791
That’s fortunate.

59
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,292
Should we have a drink?

60
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:40,545
A drink?

61
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:42,672
Aren't you working tomorrow?

62
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:44,632
Me?

63
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm not working.

64
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:48,344
Ah

65
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,097
Ah

66
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,306
Oh, you're the one working.

67
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,308
No, not really.

68
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,394
I'm not working either.

69
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:57,854
Not yet.

70
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,817
I'll buy the drinks.

71
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:03,943
Let's go.

72
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,743
Ah, why is it so cold?

73
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:13,911
Is the heater off?

74
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,498
How can it be colder inside?

75
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,502
Ah, right.

76
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,504
The gas was cut off.

77
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,300
It's been overdue for two months.

78
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,426
What should we do?

79
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,760
It's so cold.

80
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,762
What does it matter?

81
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,014
I have this here.

82
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,103
Ta-da!

83
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,109
Oh!

84
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,402
It's really not cold.

85
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:48,112
It's actually hot.

86
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:49,363
Right?

87
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,699
We can get through this winter with this.

88
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:53,743
Hey,

89
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,579
It's because you're awake.

90
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,164
If you sleep, you'll turn over.

91
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,459
I liked that about you.

92
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,544
What?

93
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:06,714
That you don't swear.

94
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:08,799
Swear?

95
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,552
Among the kids we hung out with,

96
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,970
was there anyone who didn't swear?

97
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,056
Every time they opened their mouth,

98
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,140
idiot,

99
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,141
punk,

100
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,226
nonsense.

101
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,605
If I said something silly,

102
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,565
I'd hear ten curses.

103
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,694
But you, you never cursed and

104
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,865
always responded so seriously.

105
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:35,743
Really?

106
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,205
That's why I liked it.

107
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:40,665
About you.

108
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,126
What you were doing in college,

109
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:45,795
I was curious about that.

110
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:47,463
Me?

111
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,299
Yeah, you.

112
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,904
You weren't curious about me, were you?

113
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,157
Well...

114
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:17,493
I did think of you occasionally.

115
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:22,456
Ah.. those were good times.

116
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,086
No worries about getting a job,

117
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,755
or about paying the gas bill.

118
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,009
It wasn’t that I missed you,

119
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,553
I missed those times.

120
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,347
That's it.

121
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:39,890
Hey,

122
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,268
I've been busy just trying to make a living.

123
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,645
Not tutoring, but working part-time jobs.

124
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,568
You're still popular, aren’t you?

125
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,446
Got a girlfriend?

126
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,905
Me?

127
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:56,782
Was I popular?

128
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,869
You were popular even back in school.

129
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,662
That...

130
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:04,332
Who was that pale-faced girl who followed you around?

131
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,751
That Jeong Hayoon.

132
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,669
Jeong Hayoon?

133
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,670
Yeah.

134
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,671
Hey, she was chasing you around,

135
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,132
crying and making a scene.

136
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,135
Why do you remember that stuff?

137
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,680
I didn’t even notice her that much back then.

138
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,725
At that time,

139
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,271
I was envious.

140
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,317
Just that.

141
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,529
If someone cried for me,

142
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,783
I wonder how painful that would feel, and yet,

143
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:41,911
on the other hand,

144
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,456
I think it’d be nice to experience that once.

145
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,250
Something like that.

146
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,838
Ah,

147
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,508
You used to love writing, didn't you?

148
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,177
That...

149
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,012
Was it at graduation?

150
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,056
You wrote the longest messages on the rolling paper,

151
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:04,058
I think you wrote the most.

152
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,603
I...

153
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,314
I cried reading that.

154
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,944
I said it back then too,

155
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,197
that you could make a living off your writing.

156
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,576
I was serious about that.

157
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,251
Right?

158
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,276
Hey,

159
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,154
Right?

160
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:00,656
It’s cold...

161
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,998
Jaemin,

162
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,750
Huh?
