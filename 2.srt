1
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,696
Hello?

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,156
What are you doing?

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,532
Just..

4
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,784
Why?

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,995
No.. do you remember Kim Nami?

6
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:38,956
Huh?

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,625
Uh.. I remember..

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,085
But why?

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,337
Ah.. you didn't get contacted, I see.

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,132
No, at the reunion, you were collecting everyone's numbers like that,

11
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,676
Asking for a magazine interview.

12
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,135
They said you caused such a scene.

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,055
Ah, but that magazine was an adult magazine.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,014
Adult magazine.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,224
Adult magazine?

16
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,435
Yes, something about writing a sex column?

17
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,272
So they told me not to associate with you anymore.

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,566
So you be careful too.

19
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:07,818
Ah..

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,194
Uh..

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,697
Hey, no matter how hard it is to find a job,

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,658
Is it okay to sell out your friends like that?

23
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,451
Wow, what a trashy guy.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,538
But I guess he's also struggling to make a living.

25
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,707
If you're not exceptionally talented,

26
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,834
It's hard to make a living by writing.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,336
That's why he does what he has to do to make a living.

28
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,464
Ugh! Don't worry, I'm not involved.

29
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,675
Yes.

30
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,535
Why?

31
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,079
Huh?

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,337
Why?

33
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,757
Ah..

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
About yesterday,

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,393
It was a mistake?

36
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,943
You made a mistake because you were drunk?

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,790
Do you want to believe that?

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,792
Huh?

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,006
You think

40
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,093
You think I hugged you just because I was really cold?

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,768
It wasn't because I was cold.

42
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,979
I said I was cold because I wanted to hug you.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,439
Mistake.

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,607
No.

45
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,531
I'm just doing what my heart tells me to do.

46
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,868
Ah..

47
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,747
Your...

48
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,877
How does your heart feel?

49
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,968
I don't know.

50
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,108
Heart..

51
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,901
Do as your heart desires.

52
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,945
That's what I'm doing.

53
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,409
But..

54
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,369
Aren't you hungry?

55
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,507
Just a moment..

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,180
You..

57
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,141
Is this your usual way?

58
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,740
I'm not sure?

59
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,291
You're my first.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,460
This is the first time I've felt this way towards a man.

61
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,296
So, just like you,

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,341
I'm a bit complicated too.

63
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,594
Ah

64
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,306
I feel like you're not saying anything,

65
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,392
and I look like a beginner,

66
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,313
and I'm afraid you'll dislike me even more.

67
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:15,899
Sorry.

68
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,319
No, it's not that.

69
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,657
How about you?

70
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,579
Have you ever felt this way?

71
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,460
You're my first too.

72
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,506
So,

73
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,261
I'm a bit scared.

74
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,306
Scared?

75
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,433
Of what?

76
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,020
Of liking you too much.

77
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,190
Even if I like you,

78
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,119
I'll like you more.

79
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,705
So,

80
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,791
don't worry.

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,654
- The unforgettable taste of first-time sex with a man -

82
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,577
Ah, what time is it now?

83
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,288
3 o'clock.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,918
Ah, I only slept for 30 minutes.

85
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,589
What about you?

86
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,423
Hmm?

87
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,471
What are you?

88
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,900
Jaemin,

89
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,069
I'll explain everything.

90
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,445
It's not what

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,697
you think it is.

92
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,949
Let's go with the flow.

93
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,743
Did you mean to do whatever you want?

94
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,830
Well...

95
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,207
Did you read it?

96
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,666
No.

97
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
Just the title seemed interesting.

98
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,713
Do you exploit people's feelings like this?

99
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:45,548
What?

100
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,008
I heard from Yongjae.

101
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,844
Even at the reunion, you were insisting on a sex column interview.

102
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,346
You really caused a scene.

103
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,516
You're really something.

104
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,518
How can you show your face?

105
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,145
Aren't you embarrassed?

106
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:00,939
Yeah,

107
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,316
I thought you might misunderstand,

108
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,361
you should have read the whole thing.

109
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,570
Without reading it thoroughly,

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,488
it's disgusting.

111
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,241
What did you say?

112
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,035
I said your article is disgusting.

113
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,039
An article written exploiting someone's genuine feelings,

114
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,582
is it even worth reading?

115
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,044
Sigh...

116
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,341
Please pack your things and leave.

117
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,568
Were you,

118
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,197
sincere every moment?

119
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,741
Pretending to defend me,

120
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,619
complaining about how hard it is to make a living by writing,

121
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,246
was all that sincere too?

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,376
Just because you seem like a better person than me,

123
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,628
does that make you feel better?

124
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,046
What?

125
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,340
Don't make me laugh!

126
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,343
As if you're the only one who's sincere.

127
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,145
- Nami -
