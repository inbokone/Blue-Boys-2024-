1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,134
The first night with a man

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,888
The confusion bloomed within the fluttering feelings

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,350
When the breath of that child touched me

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,020
I returned to being an eighteen-year-old boy

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,689
Would that child feel the same?

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,484
The more I got to know that child

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,110
The confusion disappeared

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,906
And only fluttering, warm feelings remained by my side

9
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,044
How about it?

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,548
Is it weird?

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,886
No

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,225
Hmm..

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,269
I like it

14
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,735
You like it?

15
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,737
My writing?

16
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:17,661
Yes, it’s very honest

17
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,956
And warm

18
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,966
I was again...

19
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,511
Worried that you might think it strange

20
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,685
Though I couldn’t express everything in the writing

21
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,523
As written in the text, at first it was curiosity

22
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,736
Now, it's genuine

23
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,873
This is my answer

24
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,375
Huh?

25
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,212
Sorry for the misunderstanding

26
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,403
Oh, wait a second, I need to make a call.

27
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,052
Why isn't it going well?

28
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,764
Uh..

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,558
I'm not sure if what I'm writing is a personal statement

30
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,227
or a fictional story.

31
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,729
Take a look at it.

32
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,318
Uh..

33
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,075
This part feels awkward, so it might be better to remove it.

34
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,622
This part..

35
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,667
It would be better if it were smoothed out, right?

36
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,669
Just a moment.

37
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,180
How about now?

38
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,853
Oh, it really feels smoother now.

39
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,730
Mr. Choi Jaemin,

40
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,525
What are you going to do with me? You should use this opportunity.

41
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,868
In my opinion, a personal statement

42
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,244
shouldn't be written

43
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,620
with the intent of just trying to impress others.

44
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,707
Hmm.. then what?

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,128
It should naturally show that

46
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,672
you are proud of yourself through the writing.

47
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,174
Like..

48
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,884
Does it convey sincerity?

49
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,136
A forced, fabricated piece of writing

50
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,971
is something the reader can also feel.

51
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,140
Awkward and exaggerated

52
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,726
Hmm..

53
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,647
You must have at least one part you're confident in

54
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,650
It would be good to focus on appealing that

55
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,112
Yes

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,158
Ah.. why

57
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,242
Because it's cute

58
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,501
Oppa

59
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,464
Hey, what are you doing here?

60
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,632
Sangmyeong Oppa said

61
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,300
Oppa usually works here

62
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,509
Came looking for Oppa

63
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,221
He wouldn’t even eat when I asked

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,557
Who? A friend?

65
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,684
Yeah, my classmate Jaemin

66
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019
Oh, hello

67
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,899
All of Oppa's friends are handsome

68
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,776
Can I sit?

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,361
Sure

70
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,598
Ah

71
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,936
Oppa was really popular in college, you know?

72
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,481
All my friends lined up asking to be introduced

73
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,440
Hey!

74
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,359
It wasn't that much, you know?

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,986
What lineup?

76
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,570
So you’re not busy, then

77
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,572
Why won’t you eat with me?

78
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,908
You’re busy

79
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,285
I’m not busy, you know?

80
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,286
Look at this

81
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,454
Always making excuses to avoid me

82
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,041
Do you have a lover

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,585
Hidden away somewhere?

84
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,132
Ah.. I guess?

85
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,009
Hey, whether I have a lover or not

86
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,635
What’s it to you?

87
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,052
What’s it to you

88
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,680
Or not

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,515
But are you doing well at work?

90
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,017
Yes, of course

91
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,311
Do you know how much my seniors adore me?

92
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,023
Hey, are you working at JK Company? Are you preparing for that?

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,941
Ah..

94
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,403
Oh, oppa, are you also preparing to apply to our company?

95
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,240
If so, I'll give you some job application tips.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,950
Can I have your number?

97
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,871
What kind of trick is this?

98
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,165
Is this a new type of flirting or what?

99
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,131
Ah!

100
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,174
Crazy..

101
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,759
Oh no, what do I do? I'm late for my part-time job now.

102
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,426
I need to go.

103
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,178
Hey, you work a part-time job too?

104
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,095
Yeah, just for today.

105
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,556
Ah, that's not what's important right now.

106
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,642
Oppa, can you drop me off just up ahead?

107
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,728
Hey, are you a child?

108
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,022
Ah, why? It's been a while since we last met.

109
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,148
Just to the taxi stand.

110
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,648
Huh?

111
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,152
I’ll drop you off and come back.

112
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,198
Ah, you really are tiring.

113
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,075
Let's go.

114
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,242
See you next time.

115
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,410
Yes.

116
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,926
honey.
