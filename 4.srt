1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,419
Wow, the weather is really nice.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,754
Shall we go out?

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:04,838
To the amusement park.

4
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:05,756
Or

5
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:06,548
The beach?

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:12,930
Jaemin.

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,515
Why.. again?

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,018
Because of Sol?

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,729
He's always a bit out of it.

10
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,605
Don't mind him.

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,569
What's wrong?

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,449
You

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,451
Have you been hiding a lover?

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,287
A lover?

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,998
What lover?

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,710
On your phone...

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,508
Who is this?

18
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,471
Ah..

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,182
Ah!

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,809
Honey

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,353
Oh, what am I saying again.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,314
Do you find this amusing?

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,482
Ah, sorry.

24
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,316
Sorry.

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,235
Hold on.

26
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,120
Honey

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,918
What are you doing?

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,587
Son!

29
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,006
Yes, it's me.

30
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,341
Why are you calling first all of a sudden?

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,926
Did you eat?

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,262
Did mom eat?

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,930
Mom ate just a bit ago.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,098
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,057
I'll be coming home later.

36
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,018
I love you.

37
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
You...

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,781
You still don't know me.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,205
Were you worried?

40
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,002
Yes.

41
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,090
What if we do this outside?

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,313
Don't do that, it's ticklish.

43
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,858
How about here?

44
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,527
You said you had to leave, right?

45
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,906
Ah, right.

46
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,157
I'll be late.

47
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,327
Why does time go by so fast?

48
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,164
Hmm.. I'll go take a shower and come back.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,141
Hello?

50
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,476
Jaemin oppa?

51
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,104
Hmm..

52
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,522
It's Sori.

53
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,358
Ah, it's Sori.

54
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,276
But what's up?

55
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,821
Oppa, do you have some time tomorrow?

56
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,114
Huh?

57
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,615
Me?

58
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,243
Yes, I have something to tell you.

59
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,288
Ah, don't tell anyone else, okay?

60
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,499
Uh..

61
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,376
Uh, yeah, okay.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,836
See you tomorrow.

63
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,644
I ordered just any coffee.

64
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,564
Uh, thanks.

65
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,569
I..

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,406
Likes Nami oppa.

67
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,868
You know?

68
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,205
Uh..

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,748
I didn't know?

70
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,670
Has it been about 3 years?

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,173
I first fell for him at the OT.

72
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,924
I've been following him ever since.

73
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,763
Confessing...

74
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,432
Did you?

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,934
Of course.

76
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,856
But oppa sees me only as a younger sibling.

77
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,651
Ah..

78
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,029
That must have been upsetting.

79
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,245
Nami oppa was popular, but...

80
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,707
He never really had a serious girlfriend, you know?

81
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,710
Just dated for fun and broke up.

82
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,716
So I was relieved...

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,887
But oppa seems different.

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,015
What does that mean...

85
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,521
What do you like about Nami oppa?

86
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,692
His good looks?

87
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,902
His height?

88
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,903
Or...

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,655
The way he spends money?

90
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,534
I don't understand what you're saying...

91
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,121
I knew it right from the start.

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,457
Ah..

93
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,252
So, Nam is oppa's new lover.

94
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,716
This time it's a man?

95
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,599
Don't meet with oppa, Nam.

96
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,061
What?

97
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,523
Because I like oppa, Nam.

98
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,441
Don't meet him.

99
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,112
Ah..

100
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm so dumbfounded I'm speechless.

101
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,244
Is it because of Sol?

102
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,415
Whether Nam dates someone or not,

103
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,833
that's Nam's freedom.

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,959
Same for me.

105
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,421
I don't think you have the right to order people around.

106
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,053
I'll go first.

107
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,100
Oppa, are you currently preparing for JK Enterprise?

108
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,648
And Miseong Enterprise would be the second choice?

109
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,735
Most of my friends and I are too.

110
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,528
We are all in that field.

111
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
If it gets out that a man is dating another man,

112
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,866
even if it's just a rumor,

113
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,661
I wonder if they can even work properly at the company?

114
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,501
What about oppa, Nam?

115
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,004
Whether he dates men or women,

116
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,174
he lives well without any worries about finding a job,

117
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,551
since his family is wealthy.

118
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,555
But how about you, oppa?

119
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,931
Employment,

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,808
is it okay if you don't get one?

121
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,844
It doesn't make sense, does it?

122
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,890
Jaemin

123
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,434
What's bothering you?

124
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,685
Is something wrong?

125
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,271
It's just that we're in different situations!

126
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,237
Let's just stop this.

127
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,574
What?

128
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,953
You might not like being ordinary, but

129
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,750
I want to live an ordinary life at least.

130
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,503
Are you serious?

131
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,465
Words that can't be taken back...

132
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,008
Don't say them.

133
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
I'm serious.

134
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,984
Take care.

135
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,292
I'll ask you one last thing.

136
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,920
If you let go of this hand now,

137
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,714
Is it really the end for us?

138
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,891
Heart...

139
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,601
Do as it wishes.

140
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,062
Even if you like me,

141
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,606
I will like you more.
